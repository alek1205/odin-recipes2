            <ul>
                <li><b>Chickpeas</b> are the base for hummus. The softened beans break down into a smooth paste.</li>
                <li><b>Tahini</b> is a paste made from ground sesame seeds, which makes hummus taste incredible.</li>
                <li><b>Fresh lemon juice</b> is essential for great hummus, so skip the bottled juice and buy fresh lemons—one large or two medium lemons should do.</li>
                <li><b>Fresh garlic</b> adds a little spice and zest. I add one small clove and find it’s just right.</li>
                <li><b>Ground cumin and salt</b> help to make it taste amazing, and the ground cumin adds a little more spice and richness.</li>
                <li><b>Olive oil</b>makes the texture of the hummus luxurious. We also drizzle over the top of the swirly hummus when serving</li>
            </ul>

           <ol>
            <li>Tahini and lemon juice go in first. Then, before you add anything else, turn on the food processor and let it run for a minute or two</li>
            <li>After a minute of being whirled, whipped, and creamed in the food processor</li>
            <li>Now, we can add the remaining hummus ingredients, but make sure you stand back and let that food processor run.</li>
            <li>I also like adding the chickpeas in two batches and processing the first batch for a minute before following up with the rest.</li>
            <li>Add a splash of cold water or aquafaba (chickpea liquid) at the very end. Pour it in while your food processor is running</li>
