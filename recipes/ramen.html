    <h2><b><em>Step's</em></b></h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <ol>
       
        <li><p><b>season the beef</b></p>I used a beef pot roast, which was great since we’re slow-cooking the meat. It always turns out tender this way.
            <p>Season the meat with black pepper.</p></li>
        
          
          <li><p><b>the onions</b></p> <p>Now that you took care of the roast, start the onions. The key here is to slice them and use A LOT.</p>
            <p>Toss the onions in a large Dutch oven that you can transfer to the oven. Let them cook along with the shallots in a little butter. You just want to get the cooking started but don’t fully cook the onions.</p></li>
        
        <li><p><b>braise</b></p>
            <p>The rest of this process is so easy. Put the roast on top of the onions. Add the remaining wine, broth, tamari (or use soy), white miso paste, chili flakes, Chinese 5 spice, and fresh ginger.</p> </li>

        <li><p><b>get the meat caramelized</b></p> <p>Once the meat has cooked, you can remove the lid and turn the heat up in the oven. Continue to cook until the meat gets some caramelization and color on top.</p>
            <p>Then, shred the meat and add the remaining broth.</p></li>
        
        <li><p><b>serve</b></p> Cook the noodles in boiling water, then arrange them in bowls. Ladle the broth and beef over the noodles.
            <p>It’s a little spicy but the flavor is spot-on, and the caramelized onions make for a rich, decadent bowl!</p>
        </li>
