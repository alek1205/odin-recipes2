                <h2><p><B><em>This egg salad recipe is brighter and fresher than most</em></B></p></h2> <p> in my opinion, it’s what a classic egg salad recipe really wants to be. It’s still rich, creamy, and flavorful, but it uses far less mayo than is traditional. Lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and (optional) capers give it a tangy, briny kick, and lots of fresh herbs take it over the top.</p>

            <div class="steps to make egg salad">

                <ol>
                    <li>Start with good hard boiled eggs. I make mine by adding the eggs to a pot of cold water and bringing the water to a boil over high heat. When it reaches a rolling boil, I remove the pot from the heat, cover it, and let the eggs sit in the hot water for 12 minutes. Then, I chill them in an ice water bath for 14 minutes before peeling. This method yields easy-to-peel eggs with yellow yolks.</li>

                    <li>Maintain some texture. The best egg salad is a little chunky, with a rich, creamy dressing surrounding it. It’s ok if the egg yolks crumble a little as you fold the chopped eggs into the dressing, but don’t mash them up too much.</li>

                    <li>Go all in on the herbs. Fresh chives and dill add bright, oniony flavor to this recipe, and they make it feel really fresh. If you don’t have one of them, use more of the other, or add fresh parsley or green onions instead. </li>
